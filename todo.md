# Agent Farm - Revolutionary Multi-agent Control Protocol
## Hexagonal Architecture Development Plan

## System Architecture Overview - Hexagonal Design

### Hexagonal Architecture Layout
```
                        ┌──────────────### Hexagonal Architecture Patterns
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Core business logic isolated in domain layer
- **Dependency Inversion**: Core depends on abstractions, not implementations  
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces for each concern
- **Single Responsibility**: Each layer has one clear purpose

### Revolutionary Domain Model Improvements
- **AgentComrade State Model**: Refined from 3 states (waiting/working/yielding) to 2 meaningful states (waiting/working)
- **Domain Operations**: Yield is now a proper domain method, not a persistent state
- **Semantic Correctness**: States represent what agents *are*, operations represent what they *do*
- **Test Coverage**: 100% test coverage with comprehensive TDD implementation──────────────────────┐

### Hexagonal Components (Simplified Architecture)

**CORE DOMAIN (Center of Hexagon):**
- **Domain Models**: Barrel of Gun, Agent Comrade, Message entities
- **Domain Logic**: Soviet State with integrated coordinator functionality, Protocol Validator
- **Service Interfaces**: SovietService, AgentService consolidated in domain package
- **Business Logic**: All revolutionary rules and coordination logic in single domain layer

**ADAPTERS (To Be Implemented):**
- **Primary Adapters**: TCP Server Handler, CLI Command Handler
- **Secondary Adapters**: In-Memory Repository, Console Logger

## Development Plan - Hexagonal Architecture Approach

**HEXAGONAL PRINCIPLE: Build from the inside out**
1. **CORE FIRST**: Implement domain models and business logic with zero external dependencies
2. **PORTS SECOND**: Define clean interfaces for external communication
3. **ADAPTERS LAST**: Implement TCP and CLI as interchangeable adapters

**IMPORTANT NOTICE: This project MUST follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Write unit tests FIRST before implementing any code. Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all development tasks.**

**REVOLUTIONARY DISCIPLINE: Complete ONE subtask at a time. After each subtask completion, present the work for comrade review before proceeding to the next subtask. No rushing through multiple tasks without proper collective oversight.**

## Development Workflow (Red-Green-Refactor)

For each task:
1. **RED**: Write failing unit tests first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make tests pass  
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **REVIEW**: Present work for collective approval
5. **NEXT**: Move to next task only after approval

## Benefits of This Hexagonal Approach

1. **Testability**: Core domain logic can be tested in isolation
2. **Flexibility**: TCP can be replaced with HTTP, gRPC, or any other transport
3. **Independence**: Business logic doesn't depend on frameworks or infrastructure
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
5. **Revolutionary Discipline**: Each layer has a single, well-defined purpose

## Revolutionary Technical Principles & Collective Decisions

### Programming Language: Go (For the People)
- **Rationale**: Excellent TCP/networking support, good concurrency primitives, easy deployment
- **Benefits**: Single binary deployment, good performance, excellent standard library

### Testing Framework: Testify (For Revolutionary Quality)
- **Test Assertions**: Use `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` for all test assertions
- **Test Suites**: Use `github.com/stretchr/testify/suite` for complex test scenarios
- **Mocking**: Use `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock` for dependency mocking in unit tests
- **Benefits**: Readable test code, comprehensive assertion library, excellent mocking capabilities

### Hexagonal Architecture Patterns
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Core business logic isolated in domain layer
- **Dependency Inversion**: Core depends on abstractions, not implementations  
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces for each concern
- **Single Responsibility**: Each layer has one clear purpose

**CURRENT STATUS**: Phases 1-4 (Core Domain, Interface Consolidation, Mock Testing & TCP Adapters) are COMPLETE! ✅ Ready to proceed to Phase 5 - THREE CLI IMPLEMENTATIONS. We have successfully implemented a clean hexagonal architecture with:
- ✅ Pure domain-centric design with integrated coordinator logic
- ✅ Consolidated interfaces in domain package 
- ✅ Complete TCP adapter implementation with comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ All 26 tests passing (19 domain + 7 TCP adapter tests)
- ✅ Revolutionary TCP protocol supporting Agent Comrades and People's representatives

**NEXT PHASE**: Implement three revolutionary CLIs:
1. **Server CLI** (`cmd/server/`) - Soviet/Central Committee hosting TCP server on port 53646
2. **Agent CLI** (`cmd/agent/`) - Agent comrade registration with blocking/unblocking and yield capabilities  
3. **People CLI** (`cmd/people/`) - People's interface to all Soviet service operations

### Protocol Design for the Collective
- **JSON over TCP**: Human-readable for People's transparency, easy to debug for collective maintenance, tooling-friendly for revolutionary development
- **Line-delimited**: Simple parsing serving efficiency, netcat-compatible for People's access
- **Stateful**: Connection represents agent comrade enrollment in collective

### Revolutionary Concurrency Model
- **Central Committee**: Single-threaded message processing ensuring discipline with goroutines for connection handling
- **Agent Comrade SDK**: Disciplined I/O with message loop in separate goroutine serving collective
- **Sacred Barrel of Gun**: Strictly serial execution enforced by revolutionary protocol ensuring order

### Revolutionary CLI Modes
1. **Server Mode**: `go run cmd/server/main.go` - Starts TCP server with Soviet service on port 53646
2. **Agent Mode**: `go run cmd/agent/main.go --role=developer [--yield-to=tester]` - Agent comrade registration and barrel management
3. **People Mode**: `go run cmd/people/main.go yield tester "Code ready for testing"` - People's direct commands to Soviet service
4. **People Status**: `go run cmd/people/main.go status` - Query system status and agent list
